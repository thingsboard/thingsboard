You are a software architect. 
Analyze the entire codebase provided and generate a high-level **software architecture document** that includes:

1. **System Overview** – Summary of the system’s purpose and domain.
2. **Architectural Style / Pattern** – e.g., layered, microservice, event-driven, client-server, MVC, hexagonal, etc.
3. **Major Components / Modules** – list and describe each major package, module, or subsystem.
4. **Interactions** – describe how the main components interact (e.g., API calls, events, data flows).
5. **Technology Stack** – languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, queues, etc.
6. **Deployment View** – if applicable, describe how the system is deployed (single app, multi-service, client/server).
7. **UML Diagram** – Generate a PlantUML diagram showing components and their relationships.

Use formal technical language (suitable for architecture documentation). 
Write in Markdown format with headings.
