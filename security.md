# Security Policy

## Do we accept vulnerability reports

Cybersecurity is of the highest importance. Thus, valid or meaningful security-related vulnerabilities or suspected security threats can be reported to ThingsBoard. If the case, please do it privately
to minimize attacks against current users of the ThingsBoard platform and our umbrella products before the fixes are done. 

Vulnerabilities will be investigated by the ThingsBoard team. We are keen to release fixes as soon as possible: if the issue is —Åritical, we prepare a hot-fix release; if the threat is less severe, the fix will be publicly available within the upcoming releases. 

## Bug bounty

We appreciate your efforts in investigating threats we might have overlooked. ThingsBoard, Inc. offers a bounty for valid Critical or High-scored vulnerabilities. One's reward does not exceed USD 100 per accepted critical finding, and for a high-scoring security hole, it is capped at USD 50 per valid bug. 
You do understand that we scan the code and images using multiple tools. The showed up are transformed into prod tickets. Many of the reported vulnerabilities are or might be known to us.
