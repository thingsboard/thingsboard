# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to Thingsbpard privately,
to minimize attacks against current users of Thingsboard before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and release as soon as possible.

To report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please email the private address security@thingsboard.io with the details of the vulnerability.
Emails will be addressed within 3 business days, including a detailed plan to investigate the issue and any potential workarounds to perform in the meantime.
Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this channel. Use GitHub issues instead.

**Proposed Email Content**
Provide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the following information:

Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.
Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed packet captures are all helpful to us).
Description of the effects of the vulnerability on Thingsboard and the related hardware and software configurations, so that the Thingsboarf Security Team can reproduce it.
How the vulnerability affects Thingsboard usage and an estimation of the attack surface, if there is one.
List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with Thingsboard to produce the vulnerability.
