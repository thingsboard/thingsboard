		<Description2><![CDATA[Notes:
                (0) Resource 6 "Serving PLMN Rate control" was moved to the APN Connection Profile Object (#11) to correctly correspond to the 3GPP specifications.

		(1) PSM Timer, Active Timer and all eDRX parameters resources are controlled by the 3GPP network. A LwM2M server may write a suggested values to these resource. As soon a LwM2M server changes the current values the device then suggests the new values to the network upon the next practical opportunity e.g. by inclusion of the requested value in an Attach or TAU request. In case the network confirms the suggested value then the device shall apply that value. In case the network provides a different value then the value provided by the network shall be applied by the device and the resource value shall be set to that value.
		The LwM2M server may use the observe function to be notified upon any changes of PSM, Active timer or eDRX parameters. By using the observe function the LwM2M server will get notified in case the value suggested by the LwM2M server is not accepted by the network, or, if the value is changed by the network for any reason (e.g., if the device moves into new tracking areas there is no guarantee that the above values remain the same and are not altered by the network).]]></Description2>
