When no new event data exists for any of the linked Event Data instances an empty Opaque value should be provided.

If this resource has an LwM2M server observation and one of the Event Data Instance is configured as Realtime and has been triggered, the Event Data Delivery object must send all undelivered events for all linked Event Data objects.
