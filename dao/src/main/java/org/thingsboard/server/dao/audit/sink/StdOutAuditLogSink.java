/**
 * The StdOutAuditLogSink class provides an implementation of the AuditLogSink interface that
 * writes audit log entries to the info-scope of standard output (stdout) using a formatted log message.
 *
 * This class is enabled when the application configuration specifies the type
 * of the audit-log sink as "stdout". It is primarily used for debugging or local development
 * purposes where audit log entries need to be observed in real-time.
 *
 * The log entries are formatted using the {@link AuditLogUtil#format(AuditLog)} method to
 * provide detailed and structured output of the audit log data.
 *
 * Annotations:
 * - {@code @Slf4j}: Enables logging functionality for logging messages.
 * - {@code @Component}: Marks this class as a Spring-managed component.
 * - {@code @ConditionalOnProperty}: Configures this class to be instantiated conditionally based
 *   on the presence and value of the "audit-log.sink.type" property in the application configuration.
